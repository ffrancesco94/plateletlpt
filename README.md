# plateletlpt
Library for lagrangian particle tracking and activation modeling of platelets. The code has mainly been used for analying the thrombogenicity of devices used in ECMO therapy (c.f. Fuchs et al. (2019), Modeling sensitivity and uncertainties in platelet activation models applied on centrifugal pumps for extracorporeal life support, and Fuchs et al. (2018), Flow-induced platelet activation in components of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit). Documentation about the methodology and usage can be found here:
